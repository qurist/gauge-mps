This directory contains input and output files on the experiment studying the convergence of the ground-state energy of
a Schwinger model in the lattice size N and the lattice spacing parameter x = 1/(ga)^2. The energy is produced via ground-state
DMRG, and the other parameters: Field cutoff "NE", mass in g units "mg" (= m/g). The bond dimension is set by a convergence criterion
that checks if the difference in energies of successive sweeps is less than a fixed threshold (usually 1e-4).

The input files specify the above parameter settings and sweep ranges.
The output files are logs containing a lot of information, including the energy after every sweep,
bond dimension, etc.

I also collect the output into more readable data files (with extension .dat).
