This directory contains input and output files on the experiment studying the accuracy of the DMRG ground state energy as a function
of electric field cutoff, over a range of parameter settings.

We vary:
- NE in {1,2,3,5,7}
- mg in {0,1,10}
- x in {10,200,1000}
- N in {30,100,300}

The input files specify the above parameter settings (one input file for each setting).
The output files are logs containing a lot of information, including the energy after every sweep,
bond dimension, etc., as well as the schmidt values at half-cut, and measurements of site observables such
as gauss' law, electric field, fermion number, and their respective variance. Note that gauss' law (and its variance)
must be zero at every site, which serves as a physics check.

I also collect the output into more readable data files (with extension .dat).
